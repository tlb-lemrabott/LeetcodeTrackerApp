- Progress monitoring across the user base  

### User Features

**Problem Management**
- Add new LeetCode problems to personal tracking list  
- Update problem status through three-stage workflow (TODO ‚Üí DOING ‚Üí DONE)  
- Edit problem information (name, description, direct link)  
- Maintain personal problem repository  

**Data Export**
- Generate and download problem lists in PDF format  
- Export data to Excel spreadsheets for offline analysis  
- Customizable report generation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a modern microservices architecture with clear separation between:  
- RESTful API backend (Spring Boot)  
- Responsive frontend interface (React.js)  
- Secure database layer (PostgreSQL)  
- Authentication and authorization middleware (Spring Security)  

## üìä Data Management

- Secure user data storage with encryption  
- Efficient problem status tracking system  
- Export functionality with multiple format support  
- Bulk operations through file processing capabilities
